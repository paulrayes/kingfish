============

Single-page theme and starter kit for Jekyll sites.

See it in action at [rayes.io/kingfish](http://www.rayes.io/kingfish).

Install
-------

Download this repository and install dependencies with:

```sh
sudo apt-get install nodejs ruby-full
sudo gem install bundler
wget -O - https://github.com/paulrayes/cloudy-skies/raw/master/update.sh | sh
```

The update script may ask for your sudo password to install additional gems.

Create your pages, for example `000-intro.md`, add add contents such as the following:

```
---
layout: default
title: Intro
permalink: /
anchor: intro
---

Insert your page contents here. The four pieces of metadata above are required.
```

Pages are sorted alphabetically, thus the numerical prefix allows you to order them however you want. The permalink of all pages must be `/`. The anchor is used for the URL hash.

Create a `_config.yml` file with the following contents, but with your site's information:

```yml
# Site settings
title: cloudy-skies
email: paul@rayes.io
description: Single-page theme and starter kit for Jekyll sites
baseurl: "/cloudy-skies" # the subpath of your site, e.g. /blog
url: "http://www.rayes.io" # the base hostname & protocol for your site
github: paulrayes/cloudy-skies
npm: cloudy-skies
prodFontUrl: /cloudy-skies/fonts/
ga: UA-XXXXXXXX-1 # Google Analytics

# Build settings
markdown: kramdown

kramdown:
  input: GFM # GitHub-flavored markdown for more features
  syntax_highlighter: rouge # Allows us to use ```-style fenced code blocks

# Don't need these
exclude: [node_modules, Gemfile, README.md, LICENSE, watch.sh, build.sh, package.json]
```

Finally create a `includes/footer.md` file with your desired footer contents, such as the following which I use for library documentation sites:

```md

Usage
-----

There are two convenience scripts included:

- `build.sh`: Builds the site, then minifies the resulting HTML page.
- `watch.sh`: Builds the site, and re-builds if files change. Does not minify.

Set the environment variable JEKYLL_ENV to "production" for a deployment-ready build.:

```sh
JEKYLL_ENV=production sh build.sh
```

These scripts do not start the jekyll server as I usually use my own.

In production, the web fonts location can be changed. This is for cacheability if you have multiple sites running this theme, so you can host a single copy of the "fonts" folder for all sites.

Updating
--------

Assuming you do not edit any of the included files, updating is easy. Just run the following:

```sh
wget -O - https://github.com/paulrayes/cloudy-skies/raw/master/update.sh | sh
```

You should not run your current copy of `update.sh` instead, because it may have changed.
